                    The web has grown into an amazing, globally accessible platform, and I'm fascinated by its
                    potential. It provides for an incredibly flexible approach towards building applications that are 
                    used by people and businesses all over the world. </p>

                    Real world applications should be intuitive, clean, fun to use and provide value
                    to everyday users. That's what I strive for in every project I develop. I enjoy learning
                    new technologies and experimenting with the cutting-edge.
